In some cases, interestingly, orientation tuning of the vessels is quite different from the orientation tuning of its neural neighborhood. In order to account for this discrepancy, the authors of that study speculate that there could be propagation of dilatory signals from adjacent neural functional columns along vessel walls. We investigate this question using a computational model of neurovascular network and explore the right pattern of lateral interactions among the vessels that can account for the orientation tuning of the cerebral vessels and the neurons they perfuse. To this end, we use a biologically plausible self-organizing network known as Gain Controlled Adaptive Laterally connected network (GCAL) to model orientation and direction sensitivity in visual cortical neurons. This neural network is bidirectionally connected with a network of vascular units. Each unit of the vascular network integrates vasodilatory signals from the neural network through weighted connections, while each neuron integrates the flux of metabolic signals from the vascular network. The vessels are assumed to have circularly symmetric, center-surround type of lateral interactions. Three alternative forms of lateral interactions among the vessel units are considered. (1) No lateral connection (2) Excitatory center and inhibitory surround (3) Inhibitory center and excitatory surround. The afferent and lateral connections of neural and vascular layers are trained using Hebbian learning for the above three cases of lateral connectivity in the vessels. The performance of the neural and vascular layer is compared with the experimental observations (O’Herron et.al 2016) and the architecture of vascular network that best matches with the experimental observation is selected. The performance is evaluated in terms of orientation selectivity index (OSI) and directionality index (DI). It is observed that when the vessels have a lateral interaction comprising of inhibitory center and/or excitatory surround, the performance of the proposed neuro-vascular system closely matches the experimental observations. The model suggests that the vascular network has active signaling within itself in an OFF-center, ON-surround fashion. These model predictions are consistent with previously reviewed evidence for existence of dynamic signaling within microvascular beds (Secomb and Pries 2002; Pradhan and Chakravarthy 2011).","tags":[],"title":"Do tuned responses in cerebral microvessels imply lateral interactions among vessels?

In the recent past both theoretical and experimental studies have suggested that the neurovascular coupling is a bidirectional system, a loop that includes a feedback signal from the vessels influencing neural firing and plasticity. An integrated model of bidirectionally connected neural network and vascular network is hence required to understand the relationship between the informational and metabolic aspects of neural dynamics. In this study, we present a computational model of the bidirectional neurovascular system in the whisker barrel cortex and study the effect of such coupling on neural activity and plasticity as manifest in the map formation. In this model, a biologically plausible self-organizing network model of rate coded, dynamic neurons is nourished by a network of vessels modeled using the biophysical properties of blood vessels. The neural layer which is designed to simulate the whisker barrel cortex of rat transmits the vasodilatory signals to the vessels. The feedback from the vessels is in the form of available oxygen for oxidative metabolism whose end result is the ATP necessary to fuel neural firing. The model captures the effect of the feedback from the vascular network on the neuronal map formation in the whisker barrel model under normal and pathological (Hypoxia and Hypoxia-Ischemia) conditions.","tags":[],"title":"A Network Architecture for Bidirectional Neurovascular Coupling in Rat Whisker Barrel Cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bhadra S.

Only the magnitude of a neuron’s firing response to orientation is considered and the neuron with the highest response is said to be “tuned” to that response. But the neuronal response to orientation is a time-varying spike train and, if the response of an entire cortical area that potentially responds to orientations in a given part of the visual field is considered, the response must be considered as a spatio-temporal wave. We propose a neural field model consisting of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons, that generates such a wave. Reflecting the dynamics of a single FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron, the neural field also exhibits excitatory and oscillatory regimes as an offset parameter is increased. We consider the question of the manner in which the input orientation is coded in the response of the neural field and discovered that two different codes − Amplitude Modulation and Phase Modulation − are present. Whereas for smaller offset values, when the model is in excitatory regime the orientation is coded in terms of amplitude, for larger offset values when the model is in the oscillatory regime, the orientation is coded in terms of phase.","tags":[],"title":"Phase and Amplitude Modulation in a Neural Oscillatory Model of the Orientation Map","type":"publication"},{"authors":["NVS Team"],"categories":null,"content":"Exploring the use of coupled oscillators to explain neurovascular interactions.\n","date":1539282600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539282600,"objectID":"144dfec8b8a44f794249c6da82cc84ba","permalink":"https://nvsteam.github.io/project/oscillators/","publishdate":"2018-10-12T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/oscillators/","section":"project","summary":"Exploring the use of coupled oscillators to explain neurovascular interactions.","tags":["Oscillators","Completed"],"title":"Coupled oscillators to explain neurovascular interactions","type":"project"}]
